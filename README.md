A special was produced in 2002, with a new magician, who, for this iteration of the show, was not Valentino, but instead an unknown performer, presenting the tricks with Kimi Bateman, Kelly Cooper, Noelle Naone, and Kadee Sweeney. A 13-part series was televised across 2008 and 2009. Allie Cohen, Lyndsay Haldorson, Samantha Faye Lee, Lauren Melendez and Paige Peterson were the principal performers.
 
Actor Mitch Pileggi presented the original series, acting as both the introducer and narrator. In the fifth special, Pileggi was replaced by narrator Mark Thompson, who served as the introducer for all the other episodes. Pileggi returned for the revived series where he solely serves as narrator.
 
The series is made by production company Nash Entertainment. The title alluded to the magician's code: the promise by working magicians not to reveal the basis of their tricks, or else risk getting blackballed by fellow magicians. The first special, which aired in November 1997, scored the highest ratings for any Fox special to that point; another three specials were broadcast through 1998.[1] Fox returned on May 15, 2002, with *Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed 5*. A new magician was wearing a new mask with artificial hair, and a purple glistening outfit. It was never revealed who portrayed the magician in this episode.
 
There is an Australian version of the show that first aired at 7:30 Monday, June 14, 2010, on Network Seven and has changed to Sundays at 6:30 on 7Two. This is the same show as the US version with some minor changes. This show also began to air on Australian pay television network Fox8 on Wednesday September 21, 2011. This version is a duplicate of the American version. Since the first run of the series, the shows have been rerun many times on Sundays on Channel 7. The show also had a Portuguese adaptation in the public TV Channel SIC, essentially a duplicate of the American version only with a different Portuguese narrator.

You can have a magical time at Walt Disney World without really knowing anything about Walt Disney World. But the *true* magic is in the stories, the *backstories*, of everything around you, and they're all here, in this definitive guide.
 
In this first book of a multi-volume set, and for the first time in print, Christopher Smith shares in comprehensive, definitive form the backstories of Walt Disney World, including storytelling elements, queues, and the "real histories" behind each ride, show, and building.
 
Walt Disney World is more than a mere collection of theme parks. It is more than resort hotels, golf courses, water parks, and restaurants. It is more than the sum of its wide-ranging parts. Disney World truly is a magical place where dreams can and do come true.
 
If you are taking the time to read this book, then you know all of that already. But have you ever asked yourself: what makes Disney World so special? What is it about this central Florida vacation destination that draws millions of guests each year from the four corners of the globe and from all walks of life? What makes Disney World different from every other non-Disney tourist destination? In other words, what makes The Most Magical Place on Earth so magical in the first place?
 
Imagineers use a variety of tools to immerse you into these fantastic stories, including the architecture of the structures located in the parks, intricate props, immersive backstories, enticing smells, music, carefully crafted and maintained vegetation, costumes, and both cutting-edge and age-old special effects. As Imagineer John Hench put it:
 
This book is your definitive guide to Disney World backstories and magical secrets, beginning in this first volume with three lands from Magic Kingdom: Main Street, U.S.A., Liberty Square, and Frontierland. In the pages that follow, you will find:
 
Christopher E. Smith is a lucky husband, a proud father, and a blessed son. He is also a corporate attorney practicing law in Huntsville, Alabama. Theme Park Press released his first book, *The Walt Disney World That Never Was: Stories Behind the Amazing Imagineering Dreams That Never Came True*, in 2016.
 
Chris has visited Walt Disney World countless times with family and friends over the course of the roughly thirty-four years since that initial trip. During that time, he has realized what so many other Disney fans already know, that Disney World is so much more than bricks and mortar, attractions and shows, and hamburgers and hotdogs. It is truly a magical place where dreams really can come true.
 
Chris lives with his wife, Alexis; his sons Dakota and Samuel; and his daughters Scarlett and Alice Anne in historic Mooresville, Alabama. When he is not spending time with his family, practicing law, or studying the history of Walt Disney World, he is cheering on his beloved alma mater, the University of Alabama. Roll Tide!
 
The backstory for Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe begins from the moment you first enter Liberty Square. As you cross into the land from the central hub, you enter a new world of early Colonial America on the brink of the Revolutionary War. The atmosphere is breathtaking, with visually stunning representations of Federal and Georgian architecture featured throughout Liberty Square, the sounds of fife and drum music playing in the background, and the smell of freshly baked funnel cake from Sleepy Hollow Refreshments.
 
Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe sits to the left of the entrance walkway once you cross the bridge from the central hub into Liberty Square, across the street from Sleepy Hollow Refreshments and Hall of Presidents. It occupies a relatively large piece of real estate (essentially an entire Colonial square).

We're always in the market for new authors with great ideas. Or great authors with new ideas. Whichever type of author you are, we'd be happy to discuss your book. Before you contact us, however, please make sure you can answer "yes" to these threshold questions:
 
We specialize in books that have some connection to Disney or theme parks. Disney, of course, has become a broad topic, and encompasses not just theme parks and films but comic books, animation, and a big chunk of pop culture. Your book should fit into one (or more) of those broad categories.
 
There's never a guarantee that *any* book will make money, but certain types of books are less likely to do so than others. They include: hardcovers, books with color photos, and books that go on forever ("forever" as in 400+ pages). We won't automatically turn down these types of books, but you'll have to be a really good salesman to convince us.
 
Writing books and publishing books should be fun. The last thing you want, and the last thing we want, is a contentious relationship. We work with authors who share our philosophy of no drama and zero attitude, and the desire for a respectful, realistic, mutually beneficial partnership.
 
As avid Harry Potter fans ourselves, my family and I embarked on this magical journey with high expectations. Little did we know, we were about to be swept away on a spellbinding tour that would rekindle our love for the series and unveil the hidden secrets of Edinburgh.
